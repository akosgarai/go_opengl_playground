# Multiple light source

This app aims to implement an application based on the [ligh casters](https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Light-casters) and the [multiple light](https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Multiple-lights) tutorials. I'm planning to draw a textured rectangle as a floor plane, a textured cube, a directional light, 2 spotlight and 2 point light.
