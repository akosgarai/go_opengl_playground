# Mouse input example with keyboard color management, and camera

This application demonstrates the mouse handler options with some keyboard inputs. The middle mouse button selects a new point. Every selected point is displayed on the screen. The button `r` sets the red, the `g` the green the `b` the blue part of the color of the point. The camera position is updatable with the `q`, `w`, `e`, `a`, `s`, `d` keys.
