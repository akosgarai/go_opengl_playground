# Menu screen

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate a menu screen, where we can manage the game state (start it, exit, setup stuff). It also should demonstrate the fonts (ttf) as texts.
The font solution is based on the [`github.com/nullboundary/glfont`](https://github.com/nullboundary/glfont) package.
