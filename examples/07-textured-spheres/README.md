# Textured spheres

This application aims to show how to draw textured spheres. The textures for the spheres were downloaded from [here](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/).
The skybox textures were generated with [wwwtyro](https://wwwtyro.github.io/space-3d/#animationSpeed=1&fov=80&nebulae=true&pointStars=true&resolution=1024&seed=2hnqv2e7hhg0&stars=true&sun=true).
