# Colors - spheres, basic lighting

The purpose of this application is the demonstration of the [materials](https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Materials) tutorial. I want a couple object (one in the center) with different materials, and one moving lightsource. The application has a camera, so that we can move with the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Q`, `E` buttons, and the mouse.
