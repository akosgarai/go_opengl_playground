# Rooms application

This application demonstrates the `Room` model. The door of the textured room can be opened or closed with the `M` button. The terrain and the water are generated with the `TerrainBuilder`. The application has a camera, so that we can move with the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Q`, `E` buttons, and the mouse. The textured room contains a window.
