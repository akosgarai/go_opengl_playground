## New

This function returns the unit sphere. The precision is the only input of this function.

## MaterialMeshInput

MaterialMeshInput method returns the verticies, indicies - inputs for the NewMaterialMesh function.

## ColoredMeshInput

ColoredMeshInput method returns the verticies, indicies - inputs for the NewColorMesh function.
