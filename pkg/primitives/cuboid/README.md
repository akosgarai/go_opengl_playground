# Cuboid

This package represents a cuboid, that is described with the points of the rectangles of the sides. The cuboid has 6 sides, each side is describes with 4 points, so that we have 24 points. Each side point so different direction, so that the length of Normals is 6.

## NewCube

## ColoredMeshInput

ColoredMeshInput method returns the verticies, indicies - inputs for the New Mesh function.

## TexturedColoredMeshInput

This method returns the verticies, indicies - inputs for the NewTexturedColoredMesh function.
